    <!-- Agreement Content -->
    <section class="agreement-content">
        <div class="container">
            <p><strong>This Ask-Nova™ Customer Agreement</strong> (the "Agreement") is between Customer and the applicable Ask-Nova™ Reseller ("Reseller") and consists of these General Terms, the applicable Service Level Agreement, and any additional terms presented when an order is placed. This Agreement takes effect when the Customer accepts it, applies to any order under this Agreement, and supersedes any prior agreements for the Ask-Nova™ platform. The individual who accepts the Agreement represents that they are authorized to enter into this Agreement on behalf of Customer. Capitalized terms have the meanings given under "Definitions."</p>

            <h2>General Terms</h2>

            <h3>License to use Ask-Nova™ Platform</h3>

            <p><strong>a. License Grant.</strong> The Ask-Nova™ platform is licensed and not sold. Upon Reseller's acceptance of each order and subject to Customer's compliance with this Agreement, Reseller grants Customer a non-exclusive and limited license to use the Ask-Nova™ platform as provided in this Agreement. This license is solely for Customer's own use and business purposes and is non-transferable except as expressly permitted under this Agreement or applicable law.</p>

            <p><strong>b. Duration of License.</strong> The Ask-Nova™ platform is licensed on a subscription basis for the specified subscription period. Subscriptions expire at the end of the applicable subscription period unless renewed. Subscriptions renew automatically until canceled unless otherwise specified.</p>

            <p><strong>c. End Users.</strong> Customer will control access to, and use of, the Ask-Nova™ platform by End Users and is responsible for any use that does not comply with this Agreement.</p>

            <p><strong>d. Token Usage.</strong> Customer's use of the Ask-Nova™ platform is subject to token consumption limits as specified in the applicable order. Each User receives 1,000,000 tokens OR 25 hours of conversation per month, whichever limit is reached first. Usage exceeding these limits will incur additional charges as specified in the pricing terms.</p>

            <p><strong>e. Reservation of Rights.</strong> Reseller and NOVA AI Inc. reserve all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. The Ask-Nova™ platform is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. No rights will be granted or implied by waiver or estoppel.</p>

            <p><strong>f. Restrictions.</strong> Customer must not (and is not licensed to): (i) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Ask-Nova™ platform or attempt to do so; (ii) work around any technical limitations in the platform; (iii) distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or lend the platform to third parties; (iv) use the platform in violation of applicable laws or regulations; (v) attempt to extract or access the underlying AI algorithms or machine learning models.</p>

            <h2>Customer Data Protection</h2>

            <p><strong>a. Customer Data Ownership.</strong> Customer Data remains the property of Customer. Reseller will process Customer Data solely to provide the Ask-Nova™ services and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

            <p><strong>b. Data Processing Agreement.</strong> Data processing terms, including security measures, data retention, and transfer procedures, are governed by the Data Processing Addendum set forth in the Ask-Nova™ Software as a Service License Agreement between Reseller and Customer.</p>

            <p><strong>c. Benchmark Data Collection.</strong> Customer acknowledges and consents that NOVA AI Inc. may collect and process benchmark data derived from the use of the Ask-Nova™ platform for the purposes of: (i) improving AI model performance and accuracy; (ii) developing platform analytics and performance metrics; (iii) conducting research and development activities; (iv) creating industry benchmarks and comparative analyses; (v) analyzing healthcare professional and practitioner behavior patterns for platform enhancement.</p>

            <p><strong>d. Benchmark Data Limitations.</strong> Benchmark data collection is subject to the following restrictions: (i) no customer commercial data, engagement records, or business-specific information will be included in benchmark datasets; (ii) no personally identifiable information or personal data will be included; (iii) all benchmark data will be aggregated and anonymized to prevent identification of Customer, its End Users, or specific healthcare professionals; (iv) benchmark data will not include customer names, contact information, transaction details, proprietary business information, or specific customer engagement activities with healthcare professionals.</p>

            <p><strong>e. Permitted Benchmark Data.</strong> Benchmark data may include: (i) technical performance metrics (response times, system usage patterns); (ii) general usage statistics (query types, interaction frequency); (iii) AI model accuracy and effectiveness measurements; (iv) platform feature utilization data; (v) aggregated industry trends and patterns (anonymized and non-attributable); (vi) healthcare professional and practitioner behavior patterns, preferences, and interaction trends in anonymized and aggregated form; (vii) clinical specialty engagement patterns and communication preferences (without identifying specific activities or customer engagement details).</p>

            <p><strong>f. Healthcare Professional Data Protection.</strong> When processing physician and practitioner behavior patterns: (i) data will focus on general behavioral patterns and preferences rather than specific activities or engagements; (ii) no information about specific customer interactions, commercial arrangements, or engagement outcomes will be included; (iii) all healthcare professional data will comply with applicable healthcare privacy regulations.</p>

            <p><strong>g. Data Segregation.</strong> Customer Data used for service provision will be kept separate from benchmark data collection processes. NOVA AI Inc. will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure Customer's confidential business information and specific engagement activities are not included in benchmark datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>h. Third-Party Sharing.</strong> Benchmark data may be shared with third parties (including academic institutions, industry organizations, or technology partners) solely in aggregated, anonymized form that cannot be traced back to Customer, any individual End User.</p>

            <p><strong>i. Opt-Out Rights.</strong> Customer may request exclusion from benchmark data collection by providing written notice to Reseller. Such opt-out will not affect the provision of Ask-Nova™ services but may limit Customer's access to industry benchmark reports and comparative analytics.</p>

            <p><strong>j. Data Subject Rights.</strong> Customer remains responsible for ensuring compliance with data subject rights under applicable privacy laws. NOVA AI Inc.'s benchmark data collection practices are designed to minimize privacy impact through anonymization and aggregation techniques that protect both Customer and healthcare professional privacy.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Claims Defense</h2>

            <p><strong>a. By Reseller.</strong> Reseller will defend Customer against any third-party claim alleging that the Ask-Nova™ platform, when used within the scope of this Agreement, directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret. If such a claim arises, Reseller may, at its option, either (1) modify the platform to avoid infringement, (2) obtain rights for Customer to continue use, or (3) terminate Customer's license and refund prepaid fees for the unused portion of the subscription.</p>

            <p><strong>b. By Customer.</strong> Customer will defend Reseller against any third-party claim alleging that Customer Data or Customer's use of the Ask-Nova™ platform violates applicable law or infringes third-party rights.</p>

            <h2>AI Ethics and Responsible Use</h2>

            <p><strong>a. Responsible AI Usage.</strong> Customer agrees to use the Ask-Nova™ platform in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines related to artificial intelligence and automated decision-making. Customer acknowledges that AI systems should be used to augment human decision-making rather than replace human judgment in critical business decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>b. Content Validation.</strong> Customer acknowledges that AI-generated responses, insights, and recommendations are based on machine learning algorithms and statistical patterns in data. Such outputs may not always be accurate, complete, or appropriate for Customer's specific circumstances. Customer is responsible for: (i) reviewing and validating all AI-generated content before acting upon it; (ii) applying appropriate human oversight to AI-assisted decisions; (iii) maintaining final decision-making authority over business-critical matters.</p>

            <p><strong>c. Prohibited Uses.</strong> Customer must not use the Ask-Nova™ platform to: (i) generate, store, or transmit content that is illegal, harmful, discriminatory, or violates third-party rights; (ii) create misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent communications; (iii) impersonate individuals or misrepresent the source of AI-generated content; (iv) process sensitive personal data without appropriate safeguards and legal basis; (v) make automated decisions that significantly affect individuals without appropriate human review; (vi) circumvent security measures or attempt to manipulate AI outputs for harmful purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>d. Bias and Fairness.</strong> Customer acknowledges that AI systems may exhibit biases present in training data or algorithmic design. Customer agrees to: (i) monitor AI outputs for potential bias or unfair treatment of individuals or groups; (ii) implement appropriate controls when using AI insights for decisions affecting employment, healthcare, financial services, or other sensitive areas; (iii) consider diverse perspectives and alternative approaches when relying on AI-generated recommendations.</p>

            <p><strong>e. Transparency and Disclosure.</strong> When Customer uses AI-generated content in external communications, Customer should consider appropriate disclosure of AI involvement, particularly in contexts where such disclosure would be expected or required by applicable law or industry standards.</p>

            <p><strong>f. Data Privacy and Consent.</strong> Customer represents and warrants that all data provided to the Ask-Nova™ platform has been collected and is being processed in compliance with applicable privacy laws and that Customer has obtained all necessary consents for AI processing of personal data.</p>

            <p><strong>g. Continuous Monitoring.</strong> Customer acknowledges the importance of ongoing monitoring of AI system performance and agrees to promptly report to Reseller any outputs that appear inappropriate, harmful, or inconsistent with intended use cases.</p>

            <p><strong>h. Platform Safeguards.</strong> NOVA AI Inc. implements technical and procedural safeguards designed to prevent generation of harmful content and promote responsible AI use. However, Customer acknowledges that no AI system is perfect and agrees to use the platform responsibly and in accordance with these ethical guidelines.</p>

            <p><strong>i. Updates to AI Ethics Standards.</strong> As AI ethics standards and regulatory requirements evolve, Reseller may update these responsible use guidelines with appropriate notice to Customer. Customer's continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of such updates.</p>
